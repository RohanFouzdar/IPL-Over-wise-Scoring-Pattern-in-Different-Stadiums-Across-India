Identification of past scoring patterns in stadiums will help teams to set the tempo of scoring while batting.

For seeing the end-visualizations, download the Over-wise Scoring Patterns.pdf from shared files.

Insights can be drawn like MA Chidambaram Stadium, which is usually a spin-friendly pitch, for which the visualization shows that usual innings tendencies are to score big in powerplay here and then run rates dip in middle-overs and then boom high in last 2-3 overs.

However, in contrast to MA Chidambaram Stadium , if you take a look at Chinnaswamy or Arun Jaitley Stadium, the run rates don't dip by a significant margin in middle overs and therefore, not much enforcement is seen in powerplay run-rates also in the latter stadiums.
